# Getting started 

## Forking 🍴

- Fork the repo to your account.
- There will be a `Fork` button on the top right corner of the repo. Click on it.
- You can copy the `main` branch of the repo to your account.

## Cloning 🌀

- After the fork is done, you will be redirected to your forked repo.
- The next step is to clone the repo to your local storage.
- Open your termnial and enter the following command. Remember to replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/Milan.git
```
- This will clone the repo to your local storage and you can start working on it.
