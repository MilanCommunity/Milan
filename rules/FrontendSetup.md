- Next to setup the *react app* `npm install`
- Once the node modules and other stuffs are installed , `npm start` to start the app in `http://localhost:3000/`

- Make changes **according** to the Tasks assigned to you
- Maintain the folder structure , keep small components like **Navbar, Footer** in `src\components` folder
