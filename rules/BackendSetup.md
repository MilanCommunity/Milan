# Backend Setup 

Follow the below setup to setup the backend locally. We are using `npm` as the package manager. So make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed in your system.

**If not installed, please read [installation guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).**
## Installing dependencies ‚è≥

- Open your terminal and navigate to the `Milan` directory.
- After that navigate to the `server` directory by typing `cd server`.
- Type `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
- Once the installation is done, you can start the frontend server by typing `npm start`.
- This should start the frontend server on `localhost:5000`.

## Techstack overview üåÄ

- We are currently using `ExpressJS v4` along with `MongoDB v6` as the backend framework.
- We are using `Nodemon` for the hot reloading.
- List of all the dependencies can be found in the `package.json` file.

## Setting up `.env`

We use a `.env` file using the `dotenv` package inside the root of the `server` directory. 

You can use the following values as denoted below, remember that if you are using your own database the data might vary. 

```bash

<!-- WE USE RAZORPAY DETAILS (TEST ACCOUNT) -->
KEY_ID=
KEY_SECRET=

<!-- YOU CAN PUT YOUR OWN MONGODB CREDENTIALS HERE -->
MONGO_URI=
PORT=""

<!-- YOU CAN PUT YOUR OWN SECRET RANDOM STRING HERE -->
JWT_SECRET=
```
## Coding standards üîê

- We are using `ESLint` and `Prettier` for linting and formatting.
- Maintain the same coding standards as the rest of the codebase. 
- Follow good naming conventions for the files, variables and functions along with proper documentation (if needed).
- We also use `husky` and `lint-staged` to run the linter and formatter before every commit. Read about this in our [Contributing Guidelines]("https://github.com/IAmTamal/Milan/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md").
- Maintain a good folder structure, incase you use anu new components or pages make sure you put them in the right folder.
- If you are using any new dependencies, make sure you mention them in the PR.
- If you are using any new Image , compress it using [online tools]("https://www.iloveimg.com/compress-image") and then use it in the project.
- **Remember**, writing readable and clean code while following the coding standards is the best thing for any developer.
